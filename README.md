# LionBet
Project for SoftUni. Lion Bet is a web apllication for making predictions for football matches.

General Requirements
Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:

The application must be implemented using Spring Framework.
The application must have at least 12 web pages (views).
The application must have at least 5 independent entity models.
The application must have at least 5 controllers.
The application must have at least 5 services.
The application must have at least 5 repositories.
Optionally, you may use Spring Data REST.
Use IntelliJ or Eclipse.
Use Thymeleaf template engine for generating the UI. Use fragments.
You could also make the Front-End using JavaScript, consuming REST services from a Web API.
Use MySQL / Oracle / PostgreSQL as a database.
Use Spring Data to access your database.
User Hibernate / EclipseLink or any other provider as a JPA implementation.
Implement Responsive Web Page Design based on Bootstrap / Google Material Design.
Use the standard Spring Security for managing users and roles.
Your registered users should have at least these roles: user and administrator.
User roles should be managable from the application.
Make sure the role management is secured and error-safe.
Use AJAX to asynchronously load and display data somewhere in your application.
Write Unit Tests for your logic, services, repository query methods, helpers, etc.
You should have at least 80% coverage on your business logic.
Implement Error Handling and Data Validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered (both client-side and server-side).
Handle correctly the special HTML characters and tags like
and <script> (escape special characters).
Use at least 2 Interceptors.
Run asynchronous tasks for jobs that do not need to run sequential or for jobs in the background.
Schedule jobs that impact the whole application running e.g. once/twice a day.
Use ModelМapper or other mapping library.
Additional Requirements
Follow the best practices for OO design and high-quality code for the Web application:
Use data encapsulation.
Use exception handling properly.
Use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly.
Follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.
Correctly format and structure your code, name your identifiers and make the code readable.
Follow the concept of thin controllers.
Well looking user interface (UI).
Good usability (easy to use UI).
Supporting of all modern Web browsers.
Use caching where appropriate.
Use a source control system by choice, e.g. GitHub, BitBucket.
Submit a link to your public source code repository.
Public Project Defense
Each student will have to deliver a public defense of its work in front of a trainer jury. Students will have only 15 minutes for the following:

Demonstrate how the application works (very shortly).
Show the source code and explain how it works. Please be strict in timing! On the 15th minute you will be interrupted! It is good idea to leave the last 4-5 minutes for questions from the jury. Be well prepared for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time:
Bring your own laptop!
Open the project assets beforehand to save time!
Bonuses
Use Spring Social to connect with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) API providers.
Host the application in a cloud environment, e.g. in Amazon Web Services.
Use a file storage cloud API, e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive or other for storing the files.
Use of features of HTML5 like Geolocation, Local Storage, SVG, Canvas, etc.
Implement Microservice architecture in your application.
Anything that is not described in the assignment is a bonus if it has some practical use.
